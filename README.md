Peer Review - Your code works, both in postman and swagger. It's organized and easy to follow, but for some reason after the first half of services have "Service" at the end but the second half doesn't. The only thing I would have done differently is not have else statements because return ends the code so there's no need for it unless it's an else if statement. Specifically I'm talking about on ReverseItNumbersOnly.cs line 18-31, if you wanted you could have just put your return without the else statement. Not much else to say, good work.
